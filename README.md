# classification-of-iris-dataset
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known and frequently used datasets in the field of machine learning and statistics.

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, where each sample represents one iris plant. Each sample is described by four features, or attributes:

1. Sepal Length: The length of the sepal (the green leaf-like structure that encloses and protects the flower bud) in centimeters.
2. Sepal Width: The width of the sepal in centimeters.
3. Petal Length: The length of the petal (the colorful part of the flower) in centimeters.
4. Petal Width: The width of the petal in centimeters.

Based on these four features, each sample is also labeled with the species of iris it belongs to. There are three species in the dataset:

1. Setosa
2. Versicolor
3. Virginica

Each species has 50 samples in the dataset, making it balanced.

#algorithms used to classify
1.**Gaussian Naive Bayes**,It is a popular classification algorithm used for solving classification problems, including the Iris dataset classification. It is an extension of the Naive Bayes algorithm, which assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class labels.
2.**k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm is another popular classification algorithm used for solving classification problems, including the Iris dataset classification. KNN is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm, meaning it doesn't make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution and doesn't learn an explicit model during training. Instead, it memorizes the entire training dataset and classifies new instances based on the similarity (distance) between the input features and the training data.
3.**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**,It is another popular and powerful classification algorithm commonly used for classifying the Iris dataset. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that aims to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data points belonging to different classes.
